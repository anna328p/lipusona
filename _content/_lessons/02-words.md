### Content words

Most words in toki pona are _content words_. <dfn>Content words</dfn> are words that have a meaning and aren't just to provide the structure of the language. Content words can act as nouns, adjectives, or verbs depending on context. In this lesson, we'll look at using them as nouns and verbs.

### _li_

A basic sentence in toki pona is structured like this:

> [x1] li [x2].

The word _li_ marks the subject of the sentence. This type of sentence means "[x1] is [x2]" or "[x1] does [x2]".

> jan li moku.  
> The person eats.  
> The person is food.

> ni li toki.  
> This one talks.  
> This is a language.

> jan li pona.  
> The person is good.

_li_ does not mean "to be".

Unlike some other languages, toki pona does not use articles. There are no words like "a" or "the".

toki pona words have many meanings:

> ijo li pona.  
> Something is good.  
> The thing is simple.  
> The being fixes something.

> jan li lipu.  
> The person is flat.

> lipu li pona.  
> The book is good.

Words aren't marked for number. This means words don't change depending on whether the subject is singular and plural.

> jan li pona.  
> People are good.

### Definitions

In dictionaries, toki pona words are usually listed as only one part of speech: as a noun, a verb, or an adjective. However, nearly any content word can be used as any part of speech! Here, I'm using "toki" as a noun, even though it only has a definition as a verb.

> This is a language.  
> This is a story.
