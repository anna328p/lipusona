### Emotional emphasis

If you want to make a sentence stronger, you can emphasize it with the particle _a_:

> ni li seli.  
> This is hot.

> ni li seli a!  
> This is really hot!

_a_ can be put at either the beginning or the end of a sentence.

> a sina pona!  
> Thank you!

<aside>
_a_ tends to be at the beginning of sentences more often in the Russian toki pona community.

_a_ adds emotional weight to speech it's emphasizing. Laughter is usually written as _a a a!_

### Addressing people and commands

If you want to call or address a particular person, use the vocative particle _o_ after their name:

> jan Netan o!  
> Nathan!

If you want to tell someone to do something, use the _o_:

> o pali e leko ni.  
> Build these stairs.

You can combine these two uses, to tell someone to do something, address someone, or express a wish or desire.

> jan Sasi o, toki!  
> Hello, Sasi!

_o_ can replace _li_ in a sentence.

> jan Maku o pona e lipu pakala.  
> Marcus, fix the damaged book.

> sina o lape.  
> I want you to sleep.

> o pali e ni, jan lete o.  
> Do this, cold people.

You can use _o_ and _a_ in the same sentence.

> jan Ana o lape a!  
> Anna, go to sleep!!

I get this one a lot

### _kin_

In _Toki Pona: The Language of Good_, _kin_ is defined as a synonym for _a_. However, most people in the community use it slightly differently.

_kin_ can be used for several things:

- To emphasize something without the emotional effect of _a_.
- As a word for "too", "also", "as well".

> ni li suli kin.  
> This is very big.

> ijo ni li pona. ijo ante li pona kin.  
> This thing is good. The other thing is good too.

### _pi_

The particle _pi_ is used to regroup modifiers.

By default, in a modifier phrase, the words modify each other from left to right.

> tomo telo nasa  
> _(tomo telo) nasa_  
> strange (water-room)  
> (maybe a strange restroom?)

By using _pi_, you can change the order of these "parentheses".

> tomo pi telo nasa  
> _tomo (telo nasa)_  
> (strange water) room 

The term _telo nasa_ ("strange water") is often used to mean alcohol, so this sentence could mean a bar.

If only one word is after _pi_, the word _pi_ should not be there. That's because there's nothing to regroup: the sentence would mean the same with or without it.

Many people confuse _pi_ with the word "of". It's true that _pi_ can often be translated as "of", but they don't mean the same thing. After all, if _pi_ meant "of", "the language of good" would be _toki pi pona_, not _toki pona_.
