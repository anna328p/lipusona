### Pronouns

In toki pona, there are three pronouns: _mi_, _sina_, and _ona_.

> mi  
> I, me, my

> sina  
> you, your

> ona  
> they, she, he, it

_mi_ or _sina_ are exceptions to the _li_ sentence structure. When the subject of a sentence is only _mi_ or _sina_, don't use _li_.

Here's some examples of sentences with pronouns:

> sina pona.  
> You are good.  
> Thank you.

> mi utala.  
> I fight.

> ona li moku.  
> She eats.

> ni li ona.  
> This is him.

### Transitive verbs and _e_

<dfn>Transitive verbs</dfn> are verbs that have an _object_. An <dfn>object</dfn> is the target of an action. For example, in English, in the sentence "I eat a fruit", the word _eat_ is a transitive verb, because it has a target: _a fruit_.

In toki pona, a transitive verb's object is marked with _e_:

> jan li weka e ijo.  
> The person throws away something.

> sina pana e lipu.  
> You give books. 

> mi open e lipu.  
> I open a book.

> ona li pona e ijo.  
> He fixes an object.
