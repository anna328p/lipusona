### Names

Sometimes, you need to refer to people and places by their name. In toki pona, you can do this using "unofficial words", also known as "loan adjectives". Names are adapted from their source language using a series of phonetic rules.

<aside>
For more information on the word conversion rules, you can look at the [foreign word page][1].
</aside>

Unlike most words in toki pona, names can _only_ be used as adjectives:

> Riley (the person)  
> jan Wali

> Canada (the country)  
> ma Kanata

> English (the language)  
> toki Inli

> Seattle (the city)  
> ma tomo Sijata

### Gender

toki pona has three words for gender:

> tonsi  
> non-binary

> meli  
> female

> mije  
> male

These words are most often used as adjectives:

> jan meli li pali e tomo.  
> The woman builds a house.

<aside>
Some people use _tonsi_, _meli_, and _mije_ as nouns: for example, _meli_ can be used to mean "woman". Personally, I dislike this usage because it puts emphasis on the gender over the person.

### Questions

There are three types of questions:

#### x ala x?

If you want to ask a question that can be answered with _yes_ or _no_, phrase the sentence normally, but use the form _x ala x_ in place of the word you're questioning.

> jan pona ni li suli ala suli?  
> Is this friend ("good person") big?

> ona li pana ala pana e kili?  
> Did they give the berry?

toki pona has no explicit words for _yes_ or _no_. The most common way to answer this type of question is to repeat the word for "yes", or to add _ala_ for "no":

> lipu li pona ala pona?  
> Is the book good?

> pona.  
> Yes.

> pona ala.  
> No.

<aside>
Some people use _lon_ for "yes" and _ala_ for "no".
</aside>

#### x anu seme?

<aside>
Some people use _anu_ as a content word meaning "choice".
</aside>

You can also append the form _anu seme_ ("or what?") to the end of your sentence.

> moku li pona anu seme?  
> Is the food good? ("The food is good or what?")

> lipu li pakala anu seme?  
> Is the book damaged? ("The book is broken or what?")

The word _anu_ can also mean "or".

#### x seme?

For more freeform questions, insert _seme_ in place of what you want to know.

> nimi sina li seme?  
> What's your name?

> ijo li seme e jan?  
> What's that object doing to the person?

> jan seme li ni?  
> Who is this person?
