_sitelen pona_ is a writing system for toki pona created by Sonja Lang. You may have already seen _sitelen pona_ symbols on the red word cards in each lesson.

Every toki pona word has a corresponding _sitelen pona_ symbol. The symbols are often representative of the meaning of the word. For example, the symbol for _poki_ (<span class="sp">poki</span>) is a stylized box.

The writing system is used in many contexts and is definitely worth learning.

The examples in this lesson will all have sitelen pona transcriptions. The sitelen pona text you see in this course is written in my font, [linja suwi].

To write a name or a foreign word in sitelen pona, for each letter in the word, write a character for a word that starts with that letter, then draw a rectangle or cartouche around it. You can choose these characters to be representative of you or the thing you're naming.
