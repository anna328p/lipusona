### Adjectives

An adjective is a word used to describe a noun. Content words can act as adjectives. You've already seen them used this way:

> jan li lili.  
> The person is small.

### Modifier phrases

You can put an adjective _after_ another word to modify it. (This is called head-initial order. This is the opposite order from some other languages, like English.) You can modify nouns, verbs, or other adjectives.

> ijo suli  
> big thing

> lipu sin  
> new book

> pana wawa  
> to give with force

When used this way, the word is called a _modifier_.

Here are some sentences that use modifiers:

> jan suli li pana e kili ike.  
> The big person gives away a bad fruit.

> lipu majuna li wawa mute.  
> The old book is very powerful.

To say that something is yours, or belongs to someone, use a pronoun as a modifier:

> ni li moku mi.  
> This is my food.

The word _ala_ can be used to mean a lack of something.

> jan ala  
> no one

> lili ala  
> not small

When the words _mi_ and _sina_ are used with a modifier, use the word _li_ to mark the predicate.

> mi pali.  
> I work.

> mi mute li pali.  
> We work.

You can use multiple modifiers for the same word. In that case, modifiers affect the whole phrase before them.

> lipu majuna  
> the old book

> lipu majuna ala  
> no old books
