### Prepositions

When you say that something is "at a location", "using a tool", or "from a place", you're using prepositions. toki pona has five prepositions.

#### lon

_lon_ means "at, in, existing". It covers a wide range of meanings that, in English, would be several words. It can also be used as a noun or a verb, meaning "existing" or "to exist".

Prepositions go before a content phrase.

> lon ni  
> "in this"  
> here

> lon poka mi  
> at my side  
> next to me

A prepositional phrase can be used as a predicate.

> ona li lon ni.  
> She is here.

> mi lon tomo sewi.  
> I'm in the upstairs apartment.

> seme li lon monsi ni?  
> What's behind this?

#### tawa

<aside>
Because _tawa_ is often used as both a content word and a preposition, it can cause ambiguity. For example, _ni li tomo tawa mi_ can mean both "this is my car" and "this is a house to me". The correct meaning of this sentence depends on context.
</aside>

_tawa_ means "to", "toward", or "in the perspective of". It also is often used as a noun, verb, or adjective meaning "movement", "to move", "moving".

You can attach a prepositional phrase to the end of a sentence to express a detail about the predicate.

> ni li pona tawa mi.  
> To me, this is good.  
> I like this.

> ona li pali e lipu lon tomo ante.  
> They're writing a book in a different room.

#### tan

_tan_ means "from", "because", or "by". It can also be used as a noun meaning "reason" or "cause".

You often see _tan_ used in questions ending in _tan seme?_ (from what?) meaning "why?"

> ike li lon tan seme?  
> Why is there evil?

You can use multiple prepositions together.

> mi lon anpa ma tan seme?  
> Why are we underground?

> ni li tan utala suli.  
> It's because of the war.

#### kepeken

<aside>
Some people use _kepeken_ as a verb meaning "to use". This usage is seen as incorrect by some people. It's widely understood. I personally try to avoid it.
</aside>

_kepeken_ means "using" or "with", as in "with a tool". (It doesn't mean "with" as in "with another person".)

> sina pali e sinpin kepeken ilo.  
> You build a wall using a tool.

> ona li tawa wawa kepeken tomo tawa.  
> He moved quickly in his car ("moving room").

#### sama

_sama_ means "as", "like". It's often used as an adjective meaning "similar", "the same", or "sibling".

> jan sama mi li pona.  
> My sibling is good.

> ona li pali sama ilo.  
> They worked like a machine.

### Other uses of prepositions

Some people use prepositions in the subject. This is especially prevalent in the dialect of _ma pona pi toki pona_, the largest toki pona Discord server.

> jan lon ma ni li pona.  
> People in this country are good.
